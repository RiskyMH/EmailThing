                EmailThing is a basic email client things of sending and receiving email through a website.
                The main reason I made this was so I can use my custom domain to send emails with (and this is probably the only reason you may want to use).

                    This site is a work in progress. If you see dummy text on a page, it means I&apos;m still working on it. You can follow updates on Discord.

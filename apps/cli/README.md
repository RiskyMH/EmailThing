# EmailThing CLI

A terminal email client with AI agent mode for email automation.

Modes:
* Normal interactive one: navigate mailboxes, read and compose emails from your terminal
* Agent mode: let your agent interact with your emails via command line

Note: This package requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as its runtime.

```sh
$ bunx @emailthing/cli
# Welcome to EmailThing CLI!
# <interactive terminal UI starts here>

$ bunx @emailthing/cli agent list # see your email list
$ bunx @emailthing/cli agent email id12345 # see that email
```

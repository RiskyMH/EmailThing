# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The only supported version is the latest. This should be the latest code with all fixes and what users should see on https://emailthing.xyz.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report any discovered vulnerabilities to me (RiskyMH) by emailing security@riskymh.dev. 
Your report will try to be acknowledged within 5 days. 
To the greatest extent possible, I will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and full announcement, 
and may ask for additional information or guidance surrounding the reported issue.

> **Note:** As EmailThing earns nothing, I won't be able to give much but I would appreciate you reporting responsibility!
